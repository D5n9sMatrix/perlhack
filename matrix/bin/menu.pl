where the quantities g µν (x) are not constant, but vary throughout spacetime—a metric tensor field. 68 The curvature tensor G µν in Eq. (1.12) is, as we’ll see, a complicated expression involving derivatives of the metric tensor field g µν (x). The Einstein field equation implies a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for g µν (x). Once the tensor components g µν (x) are known, the equations of motion for particles and photons are known. Particles and photons in free fall (subject to no forces other than gravity) follow geodesic R curves, the shortest possible paths in spacetime, 
determined through a variational principle δ ds = 0. Motion, however, determines the energy momentum tensor T µν . There is thus a feedback mechanism; see Fig. 1.13. Motion determines the

GR explains gravity in terms of a varying metrical relation between neighboring spacetime points, g µν (x), wherein par-

1.7.5 Gravity is spacetime
That last statement requires elaboration, which we’ll do in a roundabout way. What do we need to understand GR? For one, we have to enlarge our mathematical toolbox. The mathematics of curvature is the province of differential geometry, the theory of tensor fields on curved manifolds. The requirement imposed by the principle of relativity, that laws of physics be independent of the reference frame used to represent them, leads to a program, the principle of covariance, of expressing equations of physics as relations among tensors because, if a tensor equation is true in one reference frame, it’s true in all reference frames. Once the mathematical foundation of tensor fields has been laid, the Einstein field equation can be introduced forthwith. It’s important to recognize that a truly new equation of physics cannot be derived from something more fundamental. Once the field equation has been written down (however it was conceived), there isn’t a lot of wiggle room: Either its predictions agree with experimental measurements or they don’t, and so far GR has passed every
test put to it. Is that all we need, more math, in particular the mathematics of tensors? (That and the physical insight of Albert Einstein.) What about SR? In a sense GR doesn’t require SR, implausible as that might sound. The thesis of GR is that energy-momentum causes spacetime curvature, where spacetime is modeled as a four-dimensional manifold. The surface of Earth is curved yet we know locally it can be approximated as flat. So too with spacetime: Curved spacetime is locally flat. Manifolds are locally flat at any point, where the condition for flatness is that the derivatives of the metric tensor vanish in a neighborhood of that point. That leaves open the question of what the
metric tensor should be for small regions of spacetime. Einstein’s answer is that it should correspond to the metric of SR. In 1911, in the time between the development of SR and that of GR, Einstein proposed the equivalence principle that the effects of gravitation are eliminated in a reference frame
of limited spatial extent that’s freely falling in gravity. In a freely falling frame, objects not subject to forces (other than gravity) remain either at rest or in a state of uniform motion; 69 a freely falling

=head1 NAME
 
NetHack::Menu - parse and interact with a NetHack menu
 
=head1 VERSION
 
version 0.08
 
=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
    use NetHack::Menu;
    my $menu = NetHack::Menu->new(vt => $term_vt102);
 
    # compile all pages of the menu
    until ($menu->at_end) {
        $term_vt102->process($nh->send_and_recv($menu->next));
    }
 
    # we want to stuff all blessed items into our bag
    $menu->select(sub { /blessed/ });
 
    # but we don't want things that will make our bag explode
    $menu->select(sub { /curedl|bag.*(holding|tricks)/ });
 
    $term_vt102->process($nh->send_and_recv($menu->commit));
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION
 
NetHack requires a lot of menu management. This module aims to alleviate the
difficulty of parsing and interacting with menus.
 
This module is meant to be as general and flexible as possible. You just give
it a L<Term::VT102> object, send the commands it gives you to NetHack, and
update the L<Term::VT102> object. Your code should look roughly the same as
the code given in the Synopsis.
 
=head1 METHODS
 
=head2 new (vt => L<Term::VT102>, select_count => (single|multi)) -> C<NetHack::Menu>
 
Takes a L<Term::VT102> (or a behaving subclass, such as
L<Term::VT102::Boundless> or L<Term::VT102::ZeroBased>). Also takes an optional
C<select_count> which determines the type of menu. C<NetHack::Menu> cannot
intuit it by itself, it depends on the application to know what it is dealing
with. Default: C<multi>.
 
=head2 select_count [single|multi] -> (single|multi)
 
Accessor for C<select_count>. Default: C<multi>.
 
WARNING: No-select menus are potentially ambiguous with --More--. See below.
 
=head2 has_menu -> Bool
 
Is there currently a menu on the screen?
 
=head2 at_end -> Bool
 
This will return whether we've finished compiling the menu. This must be
called for each page because this is what does all the compilation.
 
Note that if there's no menu, this will C<croak>.
 
=head2 all_items -> [ NetHack::Menu::Item ]
 
Returns all items in the menu.
 
=head2 selected_items -> [ NetHack::Menu::Item ]
 
Returns all selected items in the menu.
 
=head2 next -> Str
 
Returns the string to be used to get to the next page. Note that you should
not ignore this method and use C<< > >> or a space if your menu may not
start on page 1. This method will make sure everything is hunky-dory anyway,
so you should still use it.
 
=head2 select Code
 
Evaluates the code for each item on the menu and selects those which produce
a true value. The code ref receives C<$_> as the text of the item (e.g.
C<a blessed +1 quarterstaff (weapon in hands)>). The code ref also receives the
item's selector (the character you'd type to toggle the item) as an argument.
 
Note that you can stack up multiple selects (and selects) before eventually
finishing the menu with C<< $menu->commit >>.
 
Do note that selecting is not the same as toggling.
 
This currently returns no useful value.
 
=head2 select_quantity Code
 
Same as select, but instead of returning a truth value the coderef should
return undef (if no change is to be made for this item), a non-negative integer
(to select a specific amount), or the special string 'all'.
 
=head2 select Code
 
Same as select, but different in the expected way. C<:)>
 
=head2 commit -> Str
 
This will return the string to be sent that will navigate the menu and toggle
the requested items.
 
=head1 TODO
 
=over 4
 
=item
 
Not everyone uses the default C<^>, C<|>, and C<< > >> menu accelerators.
Provide a way to change them.
 
=item
 
Not everyone uses L<Term::VT102>. Provide some way to pass in just a string or
something. This will be added on an if-needed basis. Anyone?
 
=back
 
=head1 BUGS
 
=head2 No-select menus
 
Unfortunately, NetHack uses the string C<--More--> to indicate a no-select
menu. This is ambiguous with a list of messages that spills over onto another
"page".
 
The expected way to handle no-select menus is to:
 
=over 4
 
=item Look at the topline
 
=item Decide if the topline is a no-select menu
 
This can be done by looking to see if it contains, for example, "Discoveries".
Note that "Things that are here" can appear on the third line. Argh!
 
=item If so, use NetHack::Menu
 
=item Otherwise, hit space
