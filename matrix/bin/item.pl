Newton’s law of gravity contains no characteristic length scale over which it applies: It’s intended to apply for any distance. GR, however, features an intrinsic length associated with a spherically symmetric mass M , the Schwarzschild radius r S ≡ 2GM/c 2 . (Remarkably, the Schwarzschild radius can be obtained p from Newtonian mechanics as the radius of an object for
which the escape velocity v esc = 2GM/R = c.) If M lies within the Schwarzschild radius, then r = r S defines an event horizon for external observers: Signals emitted cannot reach outside ob-
servers and we have a black hole. Black holes are regions of spacetime from which nothing, not even light, can escape. For black holes, E grav /E rel = 2 1 . Clearly implicit in the description of a black hole is the prediction that gravity affects the propagation of light. Gravitational lensing, the deflection oflight by gravity, is an experimental tool for investigating dark matter, a hypothesized form of matter that, while not luminous, can nevertheless be inferred from its gravitational influences.

For the universe, GM/Rc 2 can be estimated from its mean mass density ρ and size R: M = 4 3 59 ρ c ≡ 3H 0 2 /(8πG) ≈ 3 πR ρ. Let ρ be the critical density obtained from cosmological theory, 1 −29 −3 2 10 g cm , where H 0 is the Hubble constant. Thus, GM/Rc = 2 (RH 0 /c) 2 . Take the size of the universe to be R = ct H where t H ≡ H 0 −1 is the Hubble time, the approximate age of the 
universe. With these substitutions, GM/Rc 2 = 12 . While one can question any of these assumptions, the larger point is that the universe is “just” as relativistic as a black hole!

Because gravity is always attractive, why doesn’t the universe collapse? Newton concluded that the universe must be infinite in extent to avoid such a collapse. GR, however, predicts an expanding universe! To preclude this possibility, 60 Einstein introduced an adjustable constant, the cosmological
constant Λ, with the purpose of producing a static, finite-sized universe. It was later shown (in 1922,by Alexander Friedmann) that GR predicts an expanding universe no matter what the value 61 of Λ. The “standard model” of cosmology, the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model, is derived from GR, including Λ, a term now thought to be associated with dark energy, a proposed form of energy
that leads to a universe that’s not only expanding, but is accelerating in its expansion. In 1998 an acceleration to the expansion of the universe was discovered, and Λ was invoked as an explanation. 6

Thus, astrophysical and cosmological phenomena 63 require for their explanation a relativistic theory of gravitation. We need a theoretical framework that can handle arbitrary gravitational fields, from the environment near planets and stars, to that of black holes, and ultimately the universe. GR is a theoretical tool for describing spacetime that incorporates the effects of gravity.

58 The
three classic tests of GR are the precession of orbits, the bending of light by gravity, and the gravitational redshift. mean density of the universe ρ is thought to be quite close to the critical value, ρ c . Knowledge of ρ is of crucial importance to cosmology, as it determines whether the universe is open or closed. It’s found that ρ/ρ c = 1.0023 ± 0.005. When contemplating a number like 10 −29 g cm −3 , it’s helpful to keep in mind the density of Earth (∼ 5.5 g cm −3 ) or the density of the sun (∼ 1.4 g cm −3 ). The universe as a gravitating system can perhaps be considered another state of matter, that which is governed by an incomprehensibly small density. 60 In 1929, it was deduced that the universe is expanding from the redshift in spectral lines observed from distant galaxies. To Einstein in 1917, it was obvious that the universe must be static. 61 As shown by Friedmann, Einstein’s static solution of the equations of GR is not stable against small perturbations. 62 The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe. 63 And even the terrestrial GPS system.

where k is a proportionality factor that depends on the unit of charge adopted. Coulomb’s law suffers from the same disease as Newton’s law—action at a distance and instantaneous interactions. What saves the day is the field concept. Charge q 1 sets up a condition in space—the electric field—that
q 2 interacts with at its location, which can be symbolized: Charge 1 ←→ Field ←→ Charge 2 . We obtain an expression for the static electric field simply by rewriting Coulomb’s law,

Now, merely writing F = qE would be a change of variables if we didn’t ascribe physical re-ality to the field. And we do ascribe reality to the field because we discover—using Maxwell’s equations—that the electromagnetic field is a dynamical quantity that propagates at the speed of light and transports energy and momentum. Through Maxwell’s equations, we discover that the electromagnetic field satisfies a wave equation. Thus, electromagnetism is not transmitted instanta-neously as Coulomb’s law would lead us to suspect, but is instead a propagating field at finite speed. Is the same true of gravity? The concept of a field, one that has dynamical properties, answers the problem posed by action at a distance: It’s the field that mediates the interaction between particles,
and the field propagates at finite speed.

where g signifies the gravitational field. The Newtonian gravitational field satisfies Gauss’s law ∇·g = −4πGρ, where ρ is the local mass density. Note that the divergence of g is negative—there’s a negative flux of field lines through any closed surface; gravity is always attractive. This seems like
a promising start, but what are the other “Maxwell equations” for gravity? Recall the crucial discoveries in electromagnetism: Charges in motion (currents) produce magnetic fields, time-varying electric fields induce magnetic fields, and time-varying magnetic fields induce electric fields. Are
there analogous phenomena in gravity? Does matter in motion lead to new phenomena, akin to a magnetic field, that affect the motion of nearby masses?

There are no “Maxwell equations” for the gravitational field that have been discovered through experiments, akin to Faraday induction. Thus there is no way, based on analogies with the electromagnetic field, to develop a field theory of gravity. Yet that’s what GR accomplishes—a relativistic
field theory of gravity distinct from the theory of the electromagnetic field. Once the machinery of GR has been developed, we’ll discover analogs between gravity and electromagnetism in limiting cases, that the gravitational field satisfies a set of equations analogous to the equations of electro-
statics and magnetostatics. GR predicts frame dragging, a gravitational analog of the Lorentz force in electromagnetism—that spacetime is altered by objects in motion, “dragging” nearby objects out of position compared to the predictions of Newtonian physics. While the frame-dragging effect is
small, experimental confirmation was reported in 2011. GR also predicts a propagating disturbance in spacetime, gravitational waves, which were detected in 2016. 64

How does GR work?
The central content of GR is the Einstein field equation which schematically has the form Local curvature of spacetime = 8πG (Local energy-momentum density) . c 4 The curvature of spacetime, or equivalently, the geometry of spacetime, is determined by the energy momentum contained in that spacetime. Spacetime curvature in turn completely determines the trajectories of particles. Mathematically, the Einstein field equation is a relation between second-
rank tensor fields 65

(You’ll know what this all means soon enough: G µν is the curvature tensor and T µν is the energymomentum tensor that describes the density and flux of energy-momentum in spacetime.) Just as Maxwell’s equations relate the electromagnetic field to its sources (charge and current densities), the
Einstein equation relates spacetime curvature to its source: energy-momentum density. In Maxwell’s equations, the electromagnetic field is on spacetime; in Einstein’s equation, spacetime itself is the field! Gravity is not a force in the usual sense; gravity is spacetime! The spacetime separation, Eq. (1.8) can be written

The metric tensor 66 contains the information required to calculate the separation between spacetime points with coordinate differences ∆x µ . Note the metric “signature” in Eq. (1.14), the terms on the diagonal, (− + ++). This pattern holds for all inertial observers; the metric tensor in SR is fixed.
Because of the minus sign for the time coordinate, the geometry is not Euclidean. 67

The worldlines of truly free particles would be straight throughout all of spacetime. When one contemplates gravitation, one realizes that global inertial frames (holding for all of spacetime) are an idealization: We can’t avoid the rest of the matter of the universe! Force-free motion can therefore
have only approximate validity. In GR the separation between spacetime points, which in Eq. (1.13) applies for finite coordinate differences ∆x µ , is replaced by infinitesimally separated spacetime coordinates dx µ

65 The Einstein field equations are a set of 10 equations between the elements of second-rank symmetric tensors in the four-dimensional geometry of spacetime. These equations are variously referred to in both the singular (Einstein’s field equation), because it’s one equation between two tensors, and in the plural (field equations), because there are 10 independent equations between the components of the curvature tensor and the energy-momentum tensor. When you refer to “Einstein’s equation,” people assume you’re referring to E = mc 2 . The Einstein field equations are vastly richer in content than
E = mc 2 . 66 All things tensor will be explained in upcoming chapters.
67 The spacetime geometry of SR is called semi-Euclidean because while not strictly a Euclidean geometry, which would have metric signature (+ + ++), is nevertheless a flat geometry.

=head1 NAME
 
NetHack::Item - parse and interact with a NetHack item
 
=head1 VERSION
 
version 0.21
 
=head1 SYNOPSIS
 
    use NetHack::Item;
    my $item = NetHack::Item->new("f - a wand of wishing named SWEET (0:3)" );
 
    $item->slot           # f
    $item->type           # wand
    $item->specific_name  # SWEET
    $item->charges        # 3
 
    $item->spend_charge;
    $item->wield;
    $item->buc("blessed");
 
    $item->charges        # 2
    $item->is_wielded     # 1
    $item->is_blessed     # 1
    $item->is_cursed      # 0
 
=head1 DESCRIPTION
 
NetHack's items are complex beasts. This library attempts to control that
complexity.
 
=head1 ATTRIBUTES
 
These are the attributes common to every NetHack item. Subclasses (e.g. Wand)
may have additional attributes.
 
=over 4
 
=item raw
 
The raw string passed in to L</new>, to be parsed. This is the only required
attribute.
 
=item identity
 
The identity of the item (a string). For example, "clear potion" will be
"potion of water". For artifacts, the base item is used for identity, so for
"the Eye of the Aethiopica" you'll have "amulet of ESP".
 
=item appearance
 
The appearance of the item (a string). For example, "potion of water" will be
"clear potion". For artifacts, the base item is used for appearance, so for
"the Eye of the Aethiopica" you'll have "pyramidal amulet" (or any of the
random appearances for amulets of ESP).
 
=item artifact
 
The name of the artifact, if applicable. The leading "The" is stripped (so
you'll have "Eye of the Aethiopica").
 
=item slot
 
The inventory or container slot in which this item resides. Obviously not
applicable to items on the ground.
 
=item quantity
 
The item stack's quantity. Usually 1.
 
=item cost
 
The amount of zorkmids that a shopkeeper is demanding for this item.
 
=item specific_name
 
A name for this specific item, as opposed to a name for all items of this
class. Artifacts use specific name.
 
=item generic_name
 
A name for all items of this class, as opposed to a name for a specific item.
Identification uses generic name.
 
=item is_wielded, is_quivered, is_greased, is_offhand
 
Interesting boolean states of an item.
 
=item is_blessed, is_cursed, is_uncursed
 
Boolean states about the BUC status of an item. If one returns true, the others
will return false.
 
=item buc
 
Returns "blessed", "cursed", "uncursed", or C<undef>.
 
=item is_holy, is_unholy
 
Synonyms for L</is_blessed> and L</is_cursed>.
