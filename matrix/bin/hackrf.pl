matter acting on spacetime (curvature determined by energy-momentum through the Einstein field equation). Such a symmetry, which might be expected generally—Newton’s third law, implies that spacetime is physical. 
• SR is based on the equivalence of IRFs established by free particles; SR is the law of inertia expressed in spacetime. All inertial observers see the worldlines of free particles as straight, and all inertial observers can claim themselves at rest. The geometry of spacetime in SR is flat. The conditions for flatness were not specified in this chapter, but a hallmark of a flat
geometry is that the metric tensor consists of constant elements, as in the Lorentz metric, Eq. (1.14). SR shows that the laws of mechanics and electromagnetism are equivalent for all inertial observers, but not gravitational phenomena, which requires the machinery of GR—the
transition from global to local IRFs.

Are the events A and B in Fig. 1.6 timelike, lightlike, or spacelike separated? That they are simultaneous in one frame, but not in another suggests what type of spacetime separation? What if in the right portion Fig. 1.6, the train was traveling from right to left, would event A still occur before B?
Note: The remainder of the exercises for Chapter 1 require no relativity. Work them using nonrelativistic physics.

1.2 Objects O 1 , O 2 , separated by a distance L, move along the x-axis with speed v < c. O 1 emits a photon toward O 2 , reflecting at event E 1 , which O 1 absorbs at event E 2 . See Fig. 1.15. Calculate the times t 1 and t 2 in terms of L, v, and c. It may be helpful to draw the “space
only” version of the diagram.

=head1 DESCRIPTION
 
This is the L<SDR> driver for L<HackRF|http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/> devices.
 
Although you can use it by itself, see the L<SDR> docs for more generic usage.
 
In order to install this module you will need C<libhackrf> installed. On Ubuntu/Debian you can run:
 
    sudo apt-get install libhackrf-dev
 
NOTE: This module creates background threads so you should not fork after creating C<SDR::Radio::HackRF> objects.
